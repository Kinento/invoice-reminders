Invoice Reminders
================

From 2009 until 2014, Kinento has sold the Magento Invoice Reminders module for 79 euro per license. From 2015 onwards, updates are no longer provided by Kinento, but the module is instead available on GitHub free of charge. The code is released under the MIT open-source license and community patches and feature additions are encouraged.

Included is the original PDF manual (manual.pdf) and the Magento Connect description (below).

Module description
================

To make sure your customers pay on time, Kinento's Invoice Reminders module provides you with an automatic reminder email based on invoice statuses. The module gives you an overview of all invoices that are awaiting payment, including data on the amount of sent reminders. With invoice or proforma attachments, a multiple-fase reminder system and different settings for prepaid or onaccount customers, Invoice Reminders provides the wanted functionality for any webshop. 

Two modules
-------------

Order Reminders is similar to Invoice Reminders, but is based on the status of orders instead of the status of invoices. 

Email templates
-------------

Three templates for a first, second, and for further reminder emails are provided, including all relevant invoice data. Additionally, the templates are customizable from within Magento (Transactional Emails), allowing to incorporate your wishes and represent your webshop's unique style. 

Attachment support
-------------

Depending on your decisions, customers might be able to pay in advance or after shipment. Invoice Reminders therefore supports both the attachment of a proforma document or an invoice. Options are available to indicate which customer groups will receive which attachment. 

Order/Invoice Reminders: since 2009
-------------

Invoice Reminders has been customized, fine-tuned, and updated since the first version of Order Reminders in 2009. It includes wide compatibility, added functionality, and many configuration options, all part of customer's feature requests since 2009.
